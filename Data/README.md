# Datasets

To reproduce this work you need five datasets. Four of them are available in the Github repository:

- :x: `GIA_Austermann_2019.nc` : 60 GB NetCDF file with 216 GIA models. The GIA models partially correspond to the models used by [Dendy et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.06.013) and [Dyer et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026839118). Dr. Jacqueline Austermann shared the models in their original format for this project.
- :white_check_mark:`sea_level_stack_spratt.csv`: Sea-level stack published by [Spratt et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1079-2016). Changes were made from the original file (`PDF` to `csv`).
- :white_check_mark: `walis.csv`: World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines summary table [See Rovere et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3961544). 
- :white_check_mark: `CaseStudy_1.kml ` : South American Atlantic sub-regions
- :white_check_mark: `CaseStudy_2.kml ` : South American Pacific sub-regions
