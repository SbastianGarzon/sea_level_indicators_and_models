# Introduction {#introduction}

Discussions about the importance of sea-level changes and their causes and consequences are common in academic and non-academic spaces [@Shennan2015research]. Multiple modern techniques as satellite observation and tide gauges provide an increasing influx of information about the real-time evolution of this phenomenon. However, as pointed by @Shennan2015research, understanding sea-level changes require information beyond modern techniques to identify long trends driving changes in sea level. For example, the study of long-term sea-level changes improves the ability to predict the consequences of a warmer world by comparing with periods with similar conditions such as the Marine Isotope Stage 5e (MIS-5e) (128-118 ka) [@rovere2019world].  For such timescales (thousands to hundred thousands of years), scientists use different techniques and approaches. On the one hand, the measurement, dating, and proxy reconstruction of sea-level indicators (SLI) allow researchers to determine the vertical elevation of the past sea level in a specific location and time. On the other hand, researchers use computational modeling to simulate global, regional, and local dynamics of drivers of sea-level changes.

Even though proxy reconstruction and modeling data are part of the same equation to study sea-level changes, there are multiple challenges to integrating their results. First, sea-level indicators (SLI) and models result from two different research communities, so integration in a shared reference frame is required. @Shennan2015research points to some challenges as the multiple definitions of relevant terms as *sea level* and *relative sea-level* between the two communities that difficult results' integration. Second, sea-level indicators (SLI) result from multiple techniques with different age and relative sea-level (RSL) uncertainties. For this reason, statistical methods need to be employed to compare SLI with a mathematically derived model. In this regard, @ashe2019statistical mention integration challenges for SLI data into statistical methods. For example,  the non-Gaussian nature of some of its features and the temporal uncertainties of the data. Additionally, multiple authors mentioned the importance of improving the standardization of SLI data to guarantee correct use of data to build, interpret and compare with deterministic models [see @Shennan2015research; @ashe2019statistical; and @hijma2015protocol]. In summary, the different origins and characteristics of sea-level indicators (SLI) and sea-level models difficult data integration.

In that context, this project aims to facilitate the integration of different data and tools used in sea-level research to study sea-level change drivers for the Last Interglacial period (LIG). Specific objectives of this project consist of developing tools to manage SLI points from a standardized database, present a methodology to compare SLI and sea-level models, and generate relevant information for discussion of the comparison method. Despite recent efforts for SLI standardization [see @hijma2015protocol; and @rovere2019world] and multiple approaches for statistical analysis of SLI [see @ashe2019statistical], there is a knowledge gap on how to integrate results from large databases of sea-level indicators and physical deterministic models in a way that facilitates its management and discussion. The significance of this approach is that it provides sea-level researchers from both SLI and modeling communities tools to explore, integrate, understand and discuss their research results in a way that guarantees better traceability of their data and methods.

Despite the difficulties of integrating this information, recent works on sea-level research have made significant contributions. On the one hand, the 'geology-oriented' has made efforts to promote the standardization of SLI. For example, @hijma2015protocol propose a database structure that stores the sea-level indicators parameters allowing different researchers to understand the origin and details of their measurements and reproduce the process to extract their temporal (age) and relative sea-level components (RSL). @rovere2019world presents a more recent SLI standardization effort called the World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines (WALIS). This database structure serves as a standard for a compilation effort of SLI for a Special Issue in the *Earth System Science Data journal*. The adoption of the WALIS database structure (see @Rovere2020) resulted in more than 6.000 sea-level indicators.

On the other hand, within the 'modeling' community, there have been increasing efforts to stimulate the sharing of information with other research communities. In this regard, @Milne2015 points to the importance of making model output available for the 'field community' (i.e., geology community) to stimulate the interaction of sea-level researchers. Sharing research output is a challenge as models are typically hundreds of large files hard to share with other researchers without proper technical infrastructure. However, some recent and continuous efforts show advances to overcome these technical barriers. For example, Prof. W.R Peltier from the University of Toronto regularly publishes updated versions of Ice Sheet Thickness and Paleotopography models (e.g., ICE-5G @peltier2004global) relevant for sea-level modeling. Similarly, @Spada2019 published $Selen^{4}$ an open-source FORTRAN program to model the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (i.e., one of the drivers of sea-level changes) that allows other researchers to produce the models in their machines. 

To explore the integration of these two different sea-level research outputs, this work presents a method for comparing the Sea level indicators from a series of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models. The method consists in computing the subtraction between the sea levels indicators and the GIA models that results in a ‘residual’ ($\varepsilon$) value. I will test the method in the passive tectonic margin along the South American Atlantic coast and the active tectonic margin on the Pacific coast. I hypothesize residual values are higher along the active tectonic margin (Pacific coast) than the passive tectonic margin (Atlantic coast). To test the hypothesis, I will compare fitted residual curves and mean residual values resulting from applying the comparison method.
