Sea-level change studies in geological time scales require integrating multiple research methods with different characteristics and contexts. This work presents a methodology to compute and analyze the residual value between the relative sea-level recorded on field observations (Sea level indicators) and the results of earth and ice models predicting the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) phenomena during the last 200 ka. The method relies on an initial Monte Carlo sampling of the temporal (age) and relative sea-level parameters of Sea-level Indicators using the World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines (WALIS) dataset. Subsequently, the proposed method compares the age and relative sea-level values with a selection from 216 GIA models with five different parameters. The document includes the explanation and code implementation of the method using a reproducible R workflow and a series of tests to evaluate the results. Similarly, the document presents two cases studying the residual values along the passive South American Atlantic margin and the active Pacific margin. Results show higher residual values for the active South American Pacific margin than the passive Atlantic one at 125 ka. Comparison within each region shows no significant differences in the residual values along each coast. Results analysis and the data context suggest that direct comparison of mean residual is unsuitable for evaluating regional differences. In this regard, GIA model parameters only seem to influence different residual values in the active Pacific margin. However, alternative explanations unrelated to geological phenomena are discussed to explain these differences. The limitations and challenges to comparing residual values are discussed, including different interpretations for the residual results. Finally, this work suggests a series of steps to expand the integration of sea-level research data.
