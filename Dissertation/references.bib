	abstract = {Estimates of marine isotope stage (MIS) 5c and 5a global mean sea level (GMSL) based on marine terraces and coastal indicators range from 15--37 m and 9--30 m below present, respectively. Tectonic displacement and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) complicate efforts to refine this range. We revisit this issue using numerical predictions of post-glacial sea-level change and updated estimates of site-specific tectonic signals based upon these predictions. Laurentide and Cordilleran peripheral bulge dynamics and variations in the gravitational effect of these ice masses dominate the GIA signal along the east and west coasts of North America. Published compilations suggest that MIS 5 sea-level indicators extending from Virginia to the Caribbean lie on the outer flank of the peripheral bulge, while those along a transect from Oregon to Baja California sit on the inner flank of the bulge. Our GIA modeling reconciles these data by adopting a significantly weaker (i.e., lower viscosity) upper mantle in analyzing data on the Pacific coast relative to the Atlantic, an inference supported by seismic tomography. We present a sensitivity analysis that compares the observed elevation of globally distributed high stand markers to a suite of GIA simulations that vary the Earth model and GMSL from the Last Interglaciation (MIS 5e, ∼130-115 ka) to 70 ka. We conclude that GMSL peaked at −8.5 $\pm$ 4.6 m (1σ) during MIS 5a and −9.4 $\pm$ 5.3 m during MIS 5c. A more restrictive analysis yields slightly wider bounds corresponding to −10.5 $\pm$ 5.5 m and −11.1 $\pm$ 6.6 m, respectively.},

@article{Martinod2016,
	abstract = {We present new cosmogenic (10Be) exposure ages obtained on Pleistocene marine abrasion shore terraces of Northern Chile between 24$\,^{\circ}$S and 32$\,^{\circ}$S in order to evaluate the temporal and spatial variability of uplift rates along the coastal forearc. Both the dispersion of cosmogenic concentrations in samples from the same terrace and data obtained in vertical profiles show that onshore erosion rates, following emergence of paleoshorelines, approached 1m/Myr. Therefore, minimum ages calculated without considering onshore erosion may be largely underestimated for Middle Pleistocene terraces. The elevation of the last interglacial (MIS-5) paleoshoreline is generally between 25 and 45m amsl, suggesting that the entire coast of the study area has been uplifting during the Upper Pleistocene at rates approaching 0.3mm/yr. Available ages for Middle Pleistocene terraces suggest similar uplift rates, except in the Altos de Talinay area where uplift may have been accelerated by the activity of the Puerto Aldea Fault. The maximum elevation of Pleistocene paleoshorelines is generally close to 250m and there is no higher older Neogene marine sediment, which implies that uplift accelerated during the Pleistocene following a period of coastal stability or subsidence. We observe that the coastal morphology largely depends on the latitudinal climatic variability. North of 26.75$\,^{\circ}$S, the coast is characterized by the presence of a high scarp associated with small and poorly preserved paleoshorelines at its foot. The existence of the coastal scarp in the northern part of the study area is permitted by the hyper-arid climate of the Atacama Desert. This particular morphology may explain why paleoshorelines evidencing coastal uplift are poorly preserved between 26.75$\,^{\circ}$S and 24$\,^{\circ}$S despite Upper Pleistocene uplift rates being comparable with those prevailing in the southern part of the study area.},

@article{Jaramunoz2015,
	abstract = {The segmentation of major fault systems in subduction zones controls earthquake magnitude and location, but the causes for the existence of segment boundaries and the relationships between long-term deformation and the extent of earthquake rupture, are poorly understood. We compare permanent and seismic-cycle deformation patterns along the rupture zone of the 2010 Maule earthquake (M8.8), which ruptured 500 km of the Chile subduction margin. We analyzed the morphology of MIS-5 marine terraces using LiDAR topography and established their chronology and coeval origin with twelve luminescence ages, stratigraphy and geomorphic correlation, obtaining a virtually continuous distribution of uplift rates along the entire rupture zone. The mean uplift rate for these terraces is 0.5 m/ka. This value is exceeded in three areas, which have experienced rapid emergence of up to 1.6 m/ka; they are located at the northern, central, and southern sectors of the rupture zone, referred to as Topocalma, Carranza and Arauco, respectively. The three sectors correlate with boundaries of eight great earthquakes dating back to 1730. The Topocalma and Arauco sectors, located at the boundaries of the 2010 rupture, consist of broad zones of crustal warping with wavelengths of 60 and 90 km, respectively. These two regions coincide with the axes of oroclinal bending of the entire Andean margin and correlate with changes in curvature of the plate interface. Rapid uplift at Carranza, in turn, is of shorter wavelength and associated with footwall flexure of three crustal-scale normal faults. The uplift rate at Carranza is inversely correlated with plate coupling as well as with coseismic slip, suggesting permanent deformation may accumulate interseismically. We propose that the zones of upwarping at Arauco and Topocalma reflect changes in frictional properties of the megathrust resulting in barriers to the propagation of great earthquakes. Slip during the 1960 (M9.5) and 2010 events overlapped with the ∼90-km-long zone of rapid uplift at Arauco; similarly, slip in 2010 and 1906 extended across the ∼60-km-long section of the megathrust at Topocalma, but this area was completely breached by the 1730 (M∼9) event, which propagated southward until Carranza. Both Arauco and Topocalma show evidence of sustained rapid uplift since at least the middle Pleistocene. These two sectors might thus constitute discrete seismotectonic boundaries restraining most, but not all great earthquake ruptures. Based on our observations, such barriers might be breached during multi-segment super-cycle events.},

	abstract = {Along the Chilean coast, peninsulas associated with bays seem to behave as a complex system. They act as barrier to propagation of megathrust earthquakes along strike. To better understand how such a system works from ocean side to more inland, we investigated the area between the Tongoy bay and the Altos de Talinay in northern Chile (∼30$\,^{\circ}$S). It represents a forearc peninsula--bay system in which a normal fault (Puerto Aldea fault) has been described as accommodating a relative vertical motion between the two parts, the peninsula being uplifted with respect to the bay. We dated shells from beach ridges by U--Th disequilibria in order to compare the bay area to the peninsula area for which 10Be dating of wave-cut platforms are available (Saillard et al., 2009). These indicate: (1) the Puerto Aldea fault activity probably ceased since at least ∼230 ka, implying the bay and peninsula parts are evolving together since then; (2) the uplift rate is variable and has decreased from ∼0.8 m/ka to ∼0.2 m/ka between ∼300 and 100 ka.},

@article{SAILLARD2011,
	abstract = {Along the San Juan de Marcona Bay of southern Peru, two spectacular sequences of preserved marine terraces record net Quaternary uplift. Previous geomorphic analysis of these paleo-shorelines has revealed evidence of upper plate deformation and regional uplift. However, in the absence of a robust absolute dating method, these studies contain substantial uncertainties concerning the numerical dating of these marine markers and thus the corresponding calculated surface uplift rates. However, field mapping, surveying the neotectonic features and 10Be dating of abraded surfaces contained within two sequences of marine terraces along this margin should allow for the robust calculation of Pleistocene uplift rates. The San Juan de Marcona Bay lies on the southern flank of the subducting and south-migrating aseismic Nazca Ridge where the maximum rates of coastal uplift are expected. In this locality, we measure high uplift rates ranging from 0.4m/ka to 0.9m/ka during the Pleistocene. Margin-parallel normal faults displace several marine terraces and influence the development of bays, thereby contributing to the configuration of paleo- and present-day coastlines. The faults have relatively low slip rates, <0.1m/ka over 400ka, and have been inactive for the last 80ka. The presence and activity of these normal faults can be directly linked to subduction zone processes, with the release and accommodation of short-term coseismic compression during megathrust subduction-zone events. In contrast, the regional permanent uplift is probably controlled by post-seismic and/or interseismic strain accumulation over longer time-scales due to inelastic behavior of the upper plate. Since at least the latest Pliocene, the San Juan de Marcona area has experienced long-term regional tectonic uplift that has increased since about 800ka due to the southward migration of the subducting Nazca Ridge. Based on migration velocity and geometry of the ridge, the influence of the Nazca Ridge on the uplift of the forearc should account for ~0.4m/ka within 145km south of the ridge axis. Hence, most of the post-400ka mean uplift rate of the San Juan de Marcona area could be explained by the Nazca Ridge subduction.},

@article{PFEIFFER2011,
	abstract = {At the Tongoy palaeobay in north-central Chile, a series of beach ridges developed during seaward progradation that took place after the MIS 11 sea-level highstand (412ka). The microrelief left by this succession of beach ridges has been well preserved from erosion due to the development of a calcrete (petrocalcic horizons), which was resistant to the chemical and physical weathering that characterized the area during humid phases of the late Pleistocene and middle Holocene. Macro- and micro-morphological analysis shows that the calcrete is of pedogenic origin and formed during two stages: in the first stage a massive (beta) calcrete developed, followed during the second stage by a laminar (alpha) calcrete. Each event in the development of the calcrete was intimately related to the foregoing process, mainly due to changes in the permeability of the profile horizons. During the first stages of development, organisms played an important role in the precipitation of calcite, which made the calcrete less permeable and favored the accumulation of ponded water during the wet season. As a result of this increased humidity, calcium carbonate with a laminar structure was precipitated. The development of the calcrete was also intimately associated with the evolution of the drainage network, which is characterized by a trellis pattern of tributaries parallel to the beach ridges. This study demonstrates the importance of soil genesis in the geomorphological evolution of landscapes.},

	abstract = {Most of the Pacific coast of the Central Andes, between 15$\,^{\circ}$S and 30$\,^{\circ}$S, display a wide (a couple of kilometres) planar feature, gently dipping oceanwards and backed by a cliff. This morphology, usually of marine origin, is called rasa, and argues for a recent and spatially continuous uplift of the margin over the 1500-km-long coastal region we describe. The cliff foot is found at a similar elevation (∼110m amsl) all over the studied area, with the exception of peninsulas such as the Mejillones Peninsula. The compilation of published chronological data and the extrapolation of re-appraised uplift rates provide evidence for a common cliff foot age of around 400ka (i.e., Marine Isotopic Stage MIS 11). This, together with other geological constraints, indicates a Quaternary renewal of uplift in the Central Andes Forearc after a late Pliocene quiescence or subsidence.},

	abstract = {Pleistocene uplift of the Chilean coast is recorded by the formation of wave-cut platforms resulting from marine erosion during sea-level highstands. In the Altos de Talinay area (~31$\,^{\circ}$S), we have identified a sequence of 5 wave-cut platforms. Using in situ produced 10Be exposure ages we show that these platforms were formed during interglacial periods at 6, 122, 232, 321 and 690 ka. These ages correspond to marine isotopic stages (MIS) or substages (MISS) 1, 5e, 7e, 9c and 17. Shoreline angle elevations used in conjunction with our chronology of wave-cut platform formation, illustrate that surface uplift rates vary from 103$\pm$69 mm/ka between 122 and 6 ka, to 1158$\pm$416 mm/ka between 321 and 232 ka. The absence of preserved platforms related to the MIS 11, 13 and 15 highstands likely reflects slow uplift rates during these times. We suggest that since 700 ka, the Altos de Talinay area was predominantly uplifted during 2 short periods following MIS 17 and MISS 9c. This episodic uplift of the Chilean coast in the Pleistocene may result from subduction related processes, such as pulses of tectonic accretion at the base of the forearc wedge.},

	abstract = {Marine terrace sequences have been investigated along the Talara Arc, a 1000-km-long stretch of the coast of Ecuador and northern Peru, characterized by subduction with a concave plan-view. Seven areas were investigated, evidencing flights of up to seven marine terraces with elevations reaching up to 360 m above mean sea level (amsl). Dating of the terraces was made using the Infra Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) technique on sands as old as MIS 9 (∼330 ka). 14C and U-series dates were obtained from fossil shells for geochronological cross control. Mean uplift rates along the Talara Arc range from about 0.10 up to 0.50 mm/yr. The strongest uplift is observed in the Manta Peninsula of Ecuador in front of the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. The uplift rate tends to slow down towards the northern and southern ends of the Talara Arc and then the transition toward the stable or subsiding coasts of central Peru and northern Ecuador and Colombia is sharp. The uplift appears to be homogeneous and related to 1) the map view curvature of the Arc, 2) the concave subduction pattern and 3) the Carnegie Ridge subduction.},

	abstract = {This paper quantifies the uplift of the Manta Peninsula and La Plata Island (Ecuador) using marine terraces. These marine terraces are part of a more extensive segment of uplifting coast extending all along the Talara arc, from 6.5$\,^{\circ}$S to 1$\,^{\circ}$N. Along this arc, the highest terraces are observed on the Manta Peninsula with five marine terraces up to 360$\pm$10m. On La Plata Island, four marine terraces are raised up to 170$\pm$10m. The terraces are dated using infrared-stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and U--Th methods. The calculated uplifts range from 0.3 to 0.5mmyr−1 for the past 300ka. The oldest terraces show a transition to the synsedimentary uplifted Plio-Pleistocene deposits of the Canoa Formation. In comparison with the lower uplift rates documented in the Santa Elena Peninsula to the south and the Esmeraldas area to the north, the uplift of the Manta Peninsula gives an account of the effect of the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge since the late Pliocene. The coastal uplift ends to the north outside the projection point of the border of the Carnegie Ridge but extends southward along the northern margin of the Gulf of Guayaquil, outside of the effect of the Carnegie Ridge, which suggests that other elements must be considered for uplift in this area. A weak scan pattern of the Carnegie Ridge along the coast is observed, but instead of a true scan motion, the context suggests the possibility of a segmented ridge and the head-on introduction in the trench of a new segment with a beveled front trending parallel to the Grijalva fracture zone. The onset of subduction of the Carnegie Ridge seems correlated with a change in the tectonic deformation of the coast, from compression conditions before the middle--late Pliocene to extension conditions during the subduction of the ridge.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the neotectonic study of Santa Clara and Pun{\'a} Islands sited in the Gulf of Guayaquil eastern part. Both islands are located on the south-western segment of the fault zone bounding to the east the North Andean Block. Fault motion and morphostructural analysis were carried out from Pleistocene age terrain. A two step deformation characterises the South Pun{\'a} tectonics. The first step involves the Zambapala Cordillera uplift that post-dates Pleistocene sediments and pre-dates a marine terrace correlated with the M.I.S. 11 or 13 (440--550 ka). The second step is the formation of a pull-apart that shows evidence of 2.9 km dextral offset since the M.I.S. 11 or 13, giving an offset mean rate of 5.3 to 6.6 mm/yr. This rate is higher than the one calculated on the Pallatanga Fault northeast of the study area, in the Western Andean Cordillera, suggesting that deformation is split in different fault segments from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the continent. The Zambapala Cordillera uplift and transpression deformation requires a compressive event that may have been induced by the subduction process during the early Pleistocene.},

Two periods of deformation are distinguished, based on large-scale Neogene to Quaternary features of the westernmost part of the Coastal Cordillera: Late Miocene to Early Pliocene deformations, characterized by a weak NE--SW to E--W extension is followed by uppermost Pliocene NW--SE to E--W compression. The Middle Pleistocene to Recent time is characterized by vertical uplift and NW--SE extension. These deformations provide clear indications of the occurrence of moderate to large earthquakes. Microseismic observations, however, indicate a lack of shallow crustal seismicity in coastal zone. We propose that both long-term brittle deformation and uplift are linked to the subduction seismic cycle.},

	abstract = {Pliocene--Quaternary tectonic extension has controlled the structural evolution of the outer forearc of northern Chile. Extensional deformation is documented by large-scale, mostly N--S-striking normal faults and open cracks that run along the forearc. The faults dip to the east and define half-graben geometries across the Coastal Cordillera (20$\,^{\circ}$45′--23$\,^{\circ}$30′S). Progressive trenchward tilting of the hangingwalls has produced internal unconformities within the graben and half-graben fill. This suggests that extension has been episodic, at least since the Pliocene. Northwest-striking dextral strike--slip faults occur in the northern part of the extensional fault zone of the Coastal Cordillera (20$\,^{\circ}$40′S--21$\,^{\circ}$10′S), where they link N--S normal faults. Hectometric open cracks occur throughout the Coastal Cordillera, some of which are spatially associated with the normal faults. Normal and dextral faults appear to accommodate long-term extensional strain, whereas open cracks are interpreted as tensile fractures formed by either concomitant normal faulting or coseismic extension. The long-term extensional regime may result from buckle folding of the margin, which in turn produces progressive uplift of the coastal area by oceanic plate subduction, followed by continental margin collapse toward the trench.},

	abstract = {Isotopic curves have been used as approximative estimators of global sea level. Calculations of the amplitude of sea-level variations during Interglacials, especially for the last Interglacial, are based on the study of emerged coral terraces. The application of different dating methods shows great uncertainty about the length of each Interglacial and also about the number, chronology and altitude of the different highstands that occur during each Interglacial. Data of raised marine terraces from areas with different geodynamic behaviour (Bermudas, Bahamas, Per{\'u}, Chile, Italy and Spain) are summarized in order to analyze the relationships between sea level and Interglacial stages. Two Interglacials have been identified for the early Pleistocene represented by two marine terraces with different highstands. During the early-middle Pleistocene, an Interglacial with several highstands is recorded in uplifted areas. During Isotopic Stage 11 at least one highstand with sea level equal or higher than present has been recorded. Similar sea-level behaviour can be suggested for Isotopic Stage 9. All the analyzed areas record two highstands during Isotopic Stage 7, when warm equatorial fauna migrate into the Mediterranean. During Isotopic Substage 5e at least two highstands took place with evidence of lowstands between them and at least one highstand during substage 5c with similar sea-level height above present MSL, except in Barbados and Bermuda. During Substage 5a at least one highstand has been recorded.},

	abstract = {Quaternary sediments along the southern Per{\'u}vian coast occur as staircase terraces of coastal and shallow-marine deposits in response to continuous uplift related to the active boundary between the Nazca and South-American plates. However, near ILO (in the same coastal stretch) the emergent Pampa del Palo terrace consists of a relatively-thick, vertical stack of shallow-marine, coastal and lagoonal deposits that indicate a rather different geodynamic behaviour. Coastal deposits are correlatable with the successive marine highstands of isotopic stages 7 (?) and 5 (substages 5e and 5c). Combining aerial photo-interpretation, geomorphological mapping, sedimentological analysis, chronostratigraphical data, and structural observations, the Pampa del Palo feature is interpreted as a faulted block that moved independently of the remaining southern Peruvian coast and, for some time between the end of Middle Pleistocene (before ca. 220 ka) and the early Late Pleistocene (ca. 120 ka), it rose more slowly or was even down-faulted relative to the rest of the southern Peruvian margin. The independent block movements ceased after substage 5e, when the Pampa del Palo ``terrace'' was incorporated into the regional uplift of the area. Since ca. 100 ka, measured uplift rates in the Ilo area amounted up to 160 mm103y when the area has been affected by a few active, NE-SE trending faults only.
Resumen
Los sedimentos cuaternarios aparecen a lo largo de la costa sur del Per{\'u} como terrazas escalonadas y encajadas, con sedimentos sublitorales y costeros, en respuesta al continuo levantamiento de la zona de contacto activo entre las placas de Nazca y Sudam{\'e}rica. Sin embargo, cerca de Ilo (en ese mismo sector costero) la terraza emergida de la Pampa del Palo contiene un registro relativamente potente de sedimentos marinos someros, costeros y lagoonales, apilados verticalmente, lo cual pone de manifiesto un comportamiento geodin{\'a}mico bastante diferente. Estos dep{\'o}sitos marinos son correlacionables con los sucesivos niveles altos del mar correspondientes a los estadios isot{\'o}picos 7 (?) y 5 (subestadios 5e y 5c). Combinando la interpretaci{\'o}n fotogeol{\'o}gica, la cartograf{\'\i}a geomorfol{\'o}gica, el an{\'a}lisis sedimentol{\'o}gico, los datos cronoestratigr{\'a}ficos y las observaciones estructurales, la terraza de la Pampa del Palo se interpreta como un bloque de falla que se movi{\'o} independientemente de la restante costa del Per{\'u} durante cierto tiempo entre finales del Pleistoceno Medio (antes de unos 220 ka) y comienzos del Pleistoceno Superior (unos 120 ka), ascendiendo m{\'a}s lentamente o incluso descendiendo.

	abstract = {{Late Cenozoic sediments from northern Chile (22--24ºS) are exposed on the coastal plain between the Coastal Cordillera to the east and tilted fault blocks of the Mejillones Peninsula to the west. During the mid-Miocene to Pliocene (?up to mid-Pleistocene) a shallow marine basin developed unconformably over basement. Sedimentation was initially restricted to a small half-graben on the western margin of the Mejillones Peninsula during the Miocene. Expansion of the basin during the early Pliocene resulted in widespread shallow marine sedimentation across the study area. Alluvial, aeolian and beach sediments were restricted to the basin margins, where sediment was supplied from the Coastal Scarp (a major cliff-line bounding the western margin of the Coastal Cordillera) and isolated (islands) fault blocks. Areas of restricted clastic input were characterized by carbonate deposition.Marine planation surfaces or terraces (0.5--600 m elevation) and associated palaeo-sea cliffs cut into Miocene--Pliocene sediments and basement rocks, developed along the coastline of northern Chile in the ?late Pliocene to late Pleistocene. A similar age for a number of late Pleistocene terraces (125 000 years) now at different elevations, suggests that they were cut during interglacial highstands (oxygen isotope stage 5). Variations in terrace elevation are attributed to faulting.Regional scale uplift (over hundreds of kilometres) of shallow marine sediments beneath an extensive pre-mid Pleistocene shoreline is considered to be related to variations in subduction zone geodynamics. The favoured hypothesis is that of aseismic ridge subduction.}},

	abstract = {Ecuador is composed of three major regions: the coast, the Cordillera and the Oriente or Amazon. In the eastern amazonic lowlands, the Quaternary begins with the deposition of the Mera/Mesa Formation, composed of coarse- and medium-grained sediments; that unit was sedimented during a dry climate, forming two large alluvial fans. An erosive episode followed, with formation of pediments at a later stage. The humid climate appeared in the Late Pleistocene, with formation of a landscape of round convex hills and narrow valleys. The last important event in the region was the deposition of a thick ash mantle in the Early Holocene. The Quaternary of the Cordillera is characterized by important volcanic activity, glacial processes and the occurrence of `cangahua', a loess-like aeolian silt composed of piroclastic materials. Lahars, debris avalanches and related phenomena are common. The coastal region during the Quaternary underwent the influence of mud flows, debris avalanches and other Cordilleran phenomena, which aggradated the area (San Tadeo Formation and other units). Sea level oscillations deposited tidal sediments in several areas during the Middle Holocene, and the occurrence of El Ni{\~n}o produced alterations in the oceanic and coastal regime during the Late Holocene.},

	abstract = {The coastal region of south-central Peru displays raised marine terraces indicating that, unlike the central Peruvian coast, it underwent a strong uplift since the Late Pliocene. These recent vertical movements, which were probably the most rapid motion experienced along the Pacific coast of South-America, are commonly considered to be closely related to the subduction of the aseismic Nazca Ridge. However, several questions regarding the geometry and the precise mechanism(s) responsible for this deformation have not yet been fully addressed. The kinematic constraints of the Andean convergence suggest that the deformation of the coastal area between Pisco and Lomas is characterized by a quite continuous sequence of uplift events progressing southwards. In spite of some difficulties encountered in precisely dating the uplifted Quaternary terraces and other remnants of Pliocene marine platforms, it is proposed that uplift rates during the Late Pleistocene reached maximum values of the order of 700 mm/103 y (as against a recently proposed estimate of 470 mm/103 y). The reconstructed finite deformation as recorded by the study area for the last 3 Ma presents a NW-SE-oriented, asymmetric dome-shaped pattern. It is emphasized that the strongest uplift has been occurring immediately south of the inland projection of the Nazca Ridge, and not along the ridge axis as envisioned by the previously constructed physical models.},

Protothaca and Muliniad-alloisoleucine/l-isoleucine values define four aminozones which are consistent with available ESR ages. Terrace reoccupation during successive high sea-level stands is inferred on the basis of litho- and aminostratigraphically defined unconformities in terrace sediments. ESR data and a nonlinear kinetic racemization model give approximate numerical ages for the aminozones and thus yield estimates of net uplift rates. These rates, averaged over intervals of one to several hundred thousand years, have ranged from less than 0.1 m/1000 yr to no more than 0.2 m/1000 yr. Such slow uplift is the cause of terrace reoccupation, as the amount of uplift between successive glacioeustatic high sea-level stands is frequently not sufficient to isolate an earlier-formed abrasion platform from rising sea level during a subsequent high stand.},

	abstract = {Marine terraces between 13.5 and 15.6$\,^{\circ}$S. latitude on the Peruvian coast preserve a history of Quaternary sea-level fluctuations and forearc movement above the subducting Nazca Ridge. Field mapping and amino acid racemization/epimerization, electron spin resonance, radiocarbon, and uranium-series disequilibrium ages from mollusk shells from terrace deposits are used to define a marine terrace chronology. Terraces on the Peruvian coast formed during global high stands of Quaternary sea level, in a similar way to the marine terraces on the west coast of the United States, and Baja California, Mexico. A last interglacial marine terrace (125 ka) is preserved on nearly every terrace flight. Along the coast from northeast to southwest, each terrace varies in elevation because of variations in the rate of coastal uplift. Variations in uplift rate from northeast to southwest in the study area are explained by a simple geometric model in which the variables are the rate of plate convergence, morphology of the Nazca Ridge, and orientation of the ridge relative to the Peruvian coast. The oblique northeastward orientation of the ridge relative to the east-west direction of plate convergence results in a ca. 70 mm/yr southeastward migration of the zone of Nazca Ridge subduction beneath the Peruvian coast. The coastal area above the northern flank and crest of the Nazca Ridge is stable or has undergone net subsidence, while the coast above the ridge crest is rising at about 0.3 m/kyr. Above the southern flank of the Nazca Ridge, the coast is rising at a rate of ca. 0.5 m/kyr, the fastest rate determined from studies of marine terraces on the coasts of Peru and Chile. South of the influence of the Nazca Ridge, uplift rates are ⩽ 0.2 m/kyr. The pattern of faster uplift above the southern flank and slower uplift above the northern flank of the ridge is a predictable consequence of oblique ridge subduction.},

	abstract = {The coastal area bordering the bay of Chala (14$\,^{\circ}$50′S., 74$\,^{\circ}$15′W.), southern Peru, contains one of the most complete sequences of Quaternary shorelines in South America. Remnants of about 27 high seastands have been preserved between present mean sea-level and +275 m. Most remnants consist of staircased marine terraces and associated deposits which are partly covered by alluvial fan and colluvial units deposited during intervening periods of lower sea-levels. No geochronological data are yet available; a tentative chronostratigraphy of the terrace sequence is based on the geometric and stratigraphic relationships between successive landforms, and deposits. We group most marine terraces into 15 `major morphostratigraphic units' (MMUs). Some of these major units seem to correlate with interglaciations, for example Isotopic Stage 5, or with interstadials (Stage 3). Higher in the Chala sequence, major morphostratigraphic units mapped during field and air-photo studies may represent only parts of Middle Pleistocene interglaciations. We infer that shorelines located at +68, +121, +168, and +184 (or +200) m correlate with the highest seastands of Isotopic Stages 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively. The proposed chronostratigraphy suggests an average uplift rate of ca. 460 mm/kyr for the Chala Bay area during the last 500 ka. This rate is slightly higher than in the surrounding coastal areas (ca. 270--350 mm/kyr), but significantly lower than rates in the area where the Nazca Ridge is being subducted below the South American Plate (maximum rate ca. 740 mm/kyr). Deformed shorelines evidence several fault displacements within the Chala basin, but such deformation does not seriously disort the record of former sea-levels in the basin. The Chala terrace sequence is the first reliable record of Middle and Late Quaternary sea-level fluctuations described from Peru.},

	abstract = {Amino acid enantiomeric ratio (dl) data for over 200 molluscs from Pleistocene marine terraces on the coast of Peru and Chile are reported. They are used to evaluate the utility of this dating method for terraces in this region. Analyzed samples represent both local relative age sequences and regionally-correlative deposits identified over a broad latitude range (14--31$\,^{\circ}$S). Aminozones are defined on the basis of data for Protothaca, supplemented with results for Mulinia and other genera. Electron spin resonance (ESR) data serve to calibrate two aminozones from Peru (ca. 15$\,^{\circ}$S) as being correlative with Oxygen Isotope Stages 5 and 7 of the marine isotope record. The latitudinal trends of enantiomeric ratios for Stage 5 samples, plotted against current mean annual temperature (CMAT), are similar to those observed for Protothaca from the North American Pacific coast. The sea level record preserved in the Peru-Chile terraces is complex and usually not clearly resolved geomorphically. Typical uplift rates of 0.1--0.2 m/ka are inferred from terrace age and elevation data, with higher rates being observed where the Nazca Ridge is being subducted beneath the coast at about 15$\,^{\circ}$S. Evidence of terrace reoccupation by sea levels with substantially different ages is found at several sites of apparent low uplift.},

	abstract = {The Beagle Channel crosses the southernmost tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego), connecting the South Atlantic with the Southeastern Pacific. Raised beaches occur up to 10 m above mean sea level (m a.m.s.l.), especially along the northern (Argentinian) shore, and have been dated using marine shells. The southern (Chilean) shore is well-known for its abundance of shell middens at different levels above the present shore, particularly along the island of Isla Navarino, but the relative sea level history in this glacially impacted landscape has not previously been investigated. In this study we present postglacial relative sea level changes on Isla Navarino, based on sediment cores from six lagoons, bogs or lakes, and stratigraphic investigations of three open sections, of which one is of MIS 5e age. In addition, one core from a lagoon in the south-western Beagle Channel has been analysed and a system of terraces was mapped in the north-western Beagle Channel. The analyses of the core sites have resulted in two tentative relative sea level curves, displaying a rapid sea level rise at 8500−6500 cal yr BP, amounting to ∼10 and 14 m in eastern and western Isla Navarino, respectively, and reaching levels of ∼8 and > 10 m, respectively, followed by a slow relative sea level fall. Our sea level observations have been compared with a range of modelling results of glacial-isostatic adjustments (GIA) for estimating timing of deglaciation and ice sheet thicknesses. Based mainly on the GIA modelling of the altitude of the MIS 5e beach sediments, situated at 13 m, we can conclude that no other uplift than GIA is needed to explain their altitude. Regarding the modelling of postglacial sea levels we can conclude that no model has been found that satisfies all of the observational evidence, but that deglaciation most likely preceded Northern Hemisphere main deglaciation by at least 3 kyr, which agrees with the deglaciation age of Isla Navarino (>16 000 cal yr BP). In addition, our model runs imply that the Patagonian and Tierra del Fuego ice sheet thicknesses were in the order of ∼1500 m.},

Tectonic processes along the South America coastline derived from Quaternary marine terraces.South America is overriding the Nazca, Antarctic, and Cocos plates, and at the same time is moving along the Caribbean and Scotia plates. Quaternary sea-level highstands are ideal benchmarks to estimate tectonic uplifts considering altitude differences along the coast. The Sangamonian highstand, corresponding to the Marine Isotopic Stage 5, is the most helpful indicator for these purposes as it is more easily preserved and spanning a record of 120,000 years. The Mid-Holocene highstand leads to errors assigned to tidal-range variations, estuarine floods, and meteorological effects; however, its maximum altitudes could confirm faster uplifting rates. The major uplifting trends were estimated in relation to the subduction of seismic or aseismic ridges along the Pacific Ocean coast. The Quaternary uplifted terraces of the Atlantic coast at Patagonia were explained by the decreasing uplift induced by the subduction of the Chile Ridge, and related to a very modern volcanic field.}},

	abstract = {The marine terraces located on the atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) were previously assigned to different sea-level highstands from the Middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. This study is focused on the analysis of the mollusc assemblages recovered from those terraces. When comparing Middle/Late Pleistocene mollusc assemblages with adjacent Holocene/modern ones, ecological changes in the fauna were recognized. The Pleistocene assemblages are less diverse and are dominated by infaunal bivalves, whereas Holocene and modern assemblages are more diverse and are dominated by epifaunal taxa, with a higher presence of gastropods. However, on a biogeographic scale, the fact that Pleistocene taxa (with the probable exception of Retrotapes sp.) are living today in the region is attributed to the location of the study sites, at the centre of the Magellan biogeographic unit, with species far away from the edges of their ranges of distribution. Regional faunistic changes and the local disappearance of Retrotapes in post-glacial benthic communities in the area are therefore interpreted on the basis of regional and local causes, most probably associated to substrate changes, and not on a global trend related to large-scale patterns.},

	abstract = {Macro-and-microfossils, including molluscs, cirripeds, echinoids, foraminifers and ostracods are a significant component of a Pleistocene marine unit located along the southern coast of the Beagle Channel, on Navarino Island, Chile. This paleontological record represents the richest and most diverse macro-and-micro assemblage recovered from Pleistocene southern South America. In total, 97 taxa were identified: 34 molluscs, 57 foraminifers, and 6 ostracods. They comprise a mixture of specimens inhabiting shallow marine environments characterized by strong bottom currents and belonging to different local communities associated with the spatial heterogeneity in this basin. The taxonomic composition of this paleofauna shows remarkable similarities with present-day fauna, indicating that both groups developed under similar environmental conditions. However, slight different climatic conditions at the age of deposition cannot be ruled out. As well, an ecosystem transition towards a truly marine environment with high number of taxa was recognized. Finally, a Hiatella-cirriped assemblage deserves special attention since the polymorphic shell of fossil and living Hiatella is used as a paleoenvironmental tool. In this regard, the small size of Hiatella in the studied marine unit is best related to its mode of life as a nestler within empty tests of barnacles, which apparently served as microenvironments for this species. Nevertheless, more geochemical data on living and fossil Hiatella shells from the Beagle Channel will be necessary to test the suitability of using this species to evaluate paleotemperatures and other sea water variations during the Quaternary.},

Facies analyses of high quality exposures in several sandpits situated in the northern part of the coastal plain provided an opportunity to examine the stratigraphic nature of these deposits. Based on distinct assemblages of physical and biogenic sedimentary structures, the vertical sequence of facies reveals a regressive (prograded) barrier with vegetated coastal dune sands overlying beach and shallow marine sediments. Progradation was probably promoted by abundant supplies of nearshore sand during the highstand and early fall of sea level (forced regression) associated with the last interglacial period, around 125 ka. As indicated by elevations of Ophiomorpha burrows, the maximum level reached by the sea was around 7 m above the present sea level. Paleocurrent data suggest that, in the studied area, shoreline orientation, hydrodynamics and sediment transport during the last interglacial highstand were similar to present-day conditions.},

Alluvial fan deposits developed along the inner part of the coastal plain were reworked during at least four major transgressive-regressive episodes, which were responsible for the construction of four barrier-lagoon depositional sequences that were preserved landward of the present coastline. Each barrier probably originated at the landward limit of a transgression and was preserved due to regression of the shoreline forced by a glacio-eustatic sea-level fall. The four barrier-lagoon systems are believed to have formed during the last 400 ka assuming a correlation with the highstands represented by the last major peaks of the oxygen isotopic record.},

Elevation of marine terraces is central to interpretation of their approximate age in this kind of tectonic setting. The recognition of Pleistocene shorelines on the South American eastern continental margin is becoming increasingly common, but data are commonly imprecise in both time and space, and the resulting chronology is based mainly on geomorphological attributes. Nine thermoluminescence dates and four optically stimulated luminescence dates of 220--206 ka and 117--110 ka were obtained for two marine terrace deposits along 340 km of coast in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil. They are correlated with the highstands of marine oxygen-isotope substages 7c and 5c sea level, respectively. The older deposit occurs mainly on the N--S-trending coast and ranges in elevation between 7.5 and 1.3 m. The latter is found along the E--W-trending coast at altitudes that vary between 1 m and 20 m. It indicates relative downfaulting of the 220--206-ka marine terrace and uplift of the 117--110-ka marine deposit, which is locally about 12 m higher than deposits of similar age described 1000 km to the south. It follows that elevation alone is an unreliable tool for establishing a Quaternary sea-level change chronology also on passive margin coastal areas.},

	abstract = {Quaternary marine terraces have been investigated along a 1000km stretch of the coast of Argentinian Patagonia. Fossil mollusc shells, most in living position and collected from raised beaches, were dated using the U-series, ESR and 14C methods. Our analyses show that Holocene sea-level in this region culminated 7000 to 8000BP at 6--7m amsl. This beach slightly increases in altitude southward. The last interglacial stage (5e) was identified at 16--17m amsl whereas the highest and morphologically most distinctive radiometrically dated terrace at 250,000 to 330,000BP exists at an elevation of 33--35m amsl. We estimate a constant rate of tectonic uplift of 0.09m/1000yr since the middle Pleistocene. Using this estimate of the local rate of tectonic uplift we correct relative sea-level (r.s.l) observations for the Holocene epoch. In turn, the inferred Holocene sea-level histories are compared with those predicted using the ICE-4G (VM2) model of the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment. This model accurately predicts r.s.l history from all sites along the northern part of the east coast of the South American continent (Venezuela, Brazil). However, along the southern part of the coast of Argentinian Patagonia there is evidence of an influence that is not accurately represented in this version of the model of the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment. We suggest that this influence could be connected to the presence of the broad continental shelf that is located offshore of this region, but the influence of significant neotectonic uplift cannot be dismissed.},

Some severe problems, however, remain as far as the accuracy of the dating results are concerned. Case studies of Patagonian Middle and Younger Quaternary marine terraces help to illustrate the potential of an improved ESR dating technique. It can be demonstrated that a discrimination of Holocene, Last Interglacial, Penultimate Interglacial and ``older'' samples is possible. A chronostratigraphic separation of the well-known Last Interglacial substages 5a, 5c, and 5e is still missing, partly due to the misleading accuracy of ESR dating results. Consequently, it cannot be decided yet whether the morphologically well-conserved Last and Penultimate Interglacial age substages result from a relative sea-level fall (glacioeustatic and/or decreasing wind intensities) during the one and the same interglacial highstand shortly after the 5e or 7 transgression maximum or whether they were deposited during the much younger sea-level sub-highstands, e.g. 5c, 5a or 7c, or 7a.},

	abstract = {ESR dating has been applied to dating marine mollusc shells for more than 15years. Many studies have yielded promising results and contributed to resolving problems in marine and coastal research such as palaeo sea-level changes and coastal neotectonic movements. However, some severe problems remain with respect to the accuracy of the dating results. In particular, problems encountered in the reliable determination of the equivalent dose (DE) have reduced the merits of the ESR dating technique. Here, we present a new approach to obtain more reliable DE values. Inflexion points in the dose response curve are considered to prevent its correct fitting. The dating of articulated shells from Holocene and last interglacial sediments help to illustrate the potential of this new method of DE determination. The estimate of the environmental dose has been refined by reconstructing the uranium uptake history of the mollusc shells.},

	abstract = {ESR dating of marine mollusc shells gives no evidence for a so-called Mid-Wisconsin sea-level high stand in Argentina and Chile. The idea of this high stand around 30,000--40,000 BP is still alive, especially in Argentina, but the evidence for it is, in our opinion and that of others, solely based on the misinterpretation of 14C dates. All ESR ages from southern South America belong either to the Holocene or the Last Interglacial or older Interglacial periods. Apart from the regional aspect, this paper deals with some methodological problems in ESR dating. Estimates have been improved by using only mollusc shells that are still closed and in living position and by introducing a plateau screening test for the determination of the accumulated dose (AD). The estimate of the environmental dose has been refined by analysing the infill sediments in the shells for their U, Th and K contents, separately from the embedding matrix. Special interest has been paid to the debated problem of early or continuous U uptake; the U contents of recent Holocene molluscs support the early uptake model. A probable solution to the problem of age overestimation of Holocene shells is also presented. Present-day shells are shown to possess frequently a fully developed signal and to give AD of 2--4, in one case up to 9 Gy. If the Holocene AD values of 14C-dated shells are corrected by subtracting these ``recent'', and spurious, values, the resulting age estimates are more consistent with radiocarbon ages.},

Data from the two most common (Mactra isabelleana and Corbula patagonica) are reported in detail. Samples were collected from Holocene shorelines (ca. 2000--6890 14C yr B.P) along ca. 350 km of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The aminostratigraphy is in general agreement with the palaeoecological evidence and radiocarbon ages. The deposits of the area of Punta Indio-Punta Piedras in the north, which show the highest DL ratios, have a different geometry and a molluscan fauna of warmer water affinity than the remaining beach ridges, and must be older. They could correspond with the climatic optimum (`Hypsithermal'). The deposits of Samborombon and Mar Chiquita probably started accumulating immediately after deposition of the Punta Indio-Punta Piedras deposits. Deposition at Mar Chiquita appears to have continued longer than at Samborombon. Older DL ratios from pre-Holocene marine deposits are difficult to interpret without geochronological calibration.},

	abstract = {The late Quaternary marginal marine deposits along eastern Argentina (Southwestern Atlantic) are reviewed according to our present knowledge. In the northeastern coastal area of Buenos Aires Province they have been assigned to a series of transgressions and regressions ranging from the late Pliocene to the late Quaternary. The most widely accepted model is Frenguelli's (1957) classical chronostratigraphical scheme of: `Belgranense', late Pleistocene marine sediments at 3--6 m above m.s.l. and ca. 26,000−>35,000 14C years BP, the `Querandinense', Pleistocene-Holocene estuarine sediments below or at present m.s.l., and the most extensive `Platense', mid-Holocene marine deposits at 4.5−2 m above m.s.l. dated at ca. 8000-1340 14C years BP. The restricted `Belgranense' deposits, recorded in Samborombon Bay, in Magdalena at ca. 32,000 BP, near Mar Chiquita at ca. 24,900 and 30,500 BP and southwards in Bah{\'\i}a Blanca at ca. 26,000--35,500 BP, may belong to an interstadial (Gonz{\'a}lez et al., 1986). The molluscan composition suggests a marine invasion of the area but not a typical interglacial cycle characterized by euhaline and warm water elements. However, the oxygen isotope record argues against an interstadial during the interval 34−27 ka and the chronological control for these deposits is very poor, suggesting that they most probably have been elevated neotectonically. The Pleistocene-Holocene `Querandinense' deposits, extensively distributed along the Bonaerensian coastal plain and continental shelf (ca. 11,000 14C years BP), with very low faunal diversity, abundance of freshwater ostracods and absence of the warm water molluscs characteristic of the Holocene ridges, indicate low salinity and cool water conditions. Further dating and isotope analysis of these deposits are required for a better understanding of the chronology of climatic events by the end of the Pleistocene in this area and to establish whether or not they could correspond to the Younger Dryas event of the northern hemisphere. `Platense' littoral ridges formed between ca. 7600 and 2500 BP extend in several subparallel rows from ca. 34$\,^{\circ}$ S to ca. 39$\,^{\circ}$ S. They formed either as beaches or possibly as sublittoral bars in Samborombon Bay, where they reach 120 km long, 10--30 m wide and up to 5 m thick at 4.5--5 m above m.s.l., or in the supratidal and intertidal zones in Mar Chiquita at 2--4 m above m.s.l. Molluscs and ostracods suggest a brackish marine to marine brackish environment of lower salinity than the modern Atlantic littoral. During the mid-Holocene, the oceanic waters were mixing with large amounts of Antarctic ice melting in the South Atlantic (Isla, 1990) probably reducing salinity along the Bonaerensian littoral. The oldest littoral ridges accumulated during the Hypsithermal and in the Punta Indio area, their different geometry and alignment, greatest age, highest diversity and warmer affinity of the molluscan fauna suggest a short interval of reversal of the atmospheric circulation pattern. Further research is necessary for a better understanding of the chronology of the marine late Quaternary deposits, coastal evolution and climatic changes in this area.},

The oldest littoral zone is found at elevations between 24 and 41 m above mean sea level and is judged to be older than Oxygen Isotope Substage 5e in age based on relatively high amino acid ratios and extrapolated from non-linear kinetic models. An intermediate aged littoral zone may be present at some locations based upon beach ridges or platforms varying in elevation between 16 and 28 m above mean sea level. dl ratios are generally lower than those for the oldest zone but show a greater variation. This zone may represent the Substage 5e sea level stand. Well defined young beach ridges 8--12 m above mean sea level are found in most locations and have been 14C dated, and verified by amino acid ratios, as being Holocene.

	abstract = {The high sea-level, corresponding to the last Pleistocene interglacial stade, left the most important records represented by extensive beach-ridge plains along the central and southern coasts of Brazil. During the maximum level, which was dated at 123,000 yr B.P. by coral samples, the relative sea-level was situated 8 $\pm$ 2 m above present level. Four generations of Quaternary marine sandy deposits have been described in southern Brazil (State of Rio Grande do Sul), where they are known as Barrier I, II, III and IV. The Barrier IV, about 4 m high, corresponds to the last great transgressive-regressive phase, whose maximum occurred about 5100 yr B.P. The Barrier III, with a height of about 8--10 m, corresponds to the penultimate transgressive-regressive period, whose maximum was produced about 123,000 yr B.P. The Barrier II, about 13--15 m high, and the Barrier I, about 20--25 m high, situated at inner positions in relation to the previous ones, have been formed during high sea-levels older than 123,000 years. Along the coastal plains of the States of Sergipe and Bahia, the high sea-level older than 123,000 years is represented only by one phase through cliffs carved within the Barreiras Formation. On the other side, along the coastalp plains of S{\~a}o Paulo, Paran{\'a} and Santa Catarina, there are marine terraces with a minimum height of 13 m above present sea-level, which are certainly older than the Barrier III, and are probably recording the transgressive-regressive period of the Barrier II (middle Pleistocene?).

	abstract = {Summary Many studies of sea-level change are implicitly inductive, depending on inferences and reasoning, where extrapolations may be made to develop generalizations. An inductive approach typically follows a line of reasoning from experience, the argument following a route from describing the effect and leading to an account of the cause. The approach of multiple working hypotheses has many advantages. A key stage in the approach is the formulation of each potential idea, hunch, and hypothesis in a testable form. In scientific literature sea level is relative in two respects: elevation relative to the surface of the Earth, and elevation relative to the present. In many studies sea-level index points are described as observations, often to separate them from estimates or predictions from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. Relative sea-level change always includes both time, relative to present or another clearly defined zero, and elevation, between the sea surface and land surface.},

	abstract = {{Modern analyses of sea level changes due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) are based on the classic sea level equation derived by Farrell \\&amp; Clark (1976, Geophys. J.R. astr. Soc., 46, 647--667). The connection between global sea level variations and changes to ocean height that is assumed within this equation breaks down in the presence of a time-varying shoreline geometry. We present a generalized sea level equation that overcomes this difficulty. We also derive analytic expressions for, and present schematic illustrations of, the error in the ocean height change over finite time intervals introduced in published efforts to incorporate shoreline evolution into the theory of GIA-induced sea level change. This comparison includes studies of shoreline migration due to either local sea level changes or the growth and ablation of marine-based ice. We conclude that the theories applied by Johnston (1993, Geophys. J. Int., 114, 615--634), Milne (1998, PhD thesis, University of Toronto, Toronto) and co-workers are more accurate than the procedure advocated by Peltier (1994, Science, 265, 195--201; 1998a, Geophys. Res. Lett., 25, 3955--3958; 1998b, Rev. Geophys., 114, 615--634), although an improvement in the latter has recently been reported (Peltier \\&amp; Drummond (2002, Geophys. Res. Lett., 29, 10.1029/2001GL014273). Our generalized theory is valid for any Earth model. In a companion paper we derive the equations necessary to treat the special case of a spherically symmetric, linear viscoelastic and rotating Earth, and we quantify errors associated with previous work.}},

	abstract = {The Last Interglacial (MIS 5e, 128--116ka) is among the most studied past periods in Earth's history. The climate at that time was warmer than today, primarily due to different orbital conditions, with smaller ice sheets and higher sea-level. Field evidence for MIS 5e sea-level was reported from thousands of sites, but often paleo shorelines were measured with low-accuracy techniques and, in some cases, there are contrasting interpretations about paleo sea-level reconstructions. For this reason, large uncertainties still surround both the maximum sea-level attained as well as the pattern of sea-level change throughout MIS 5e. Such uncertainties are exacerbated by the lack of a uniform approach to measuring and interpreting the geological evidence of paleo sea-levels. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of MIS 5e field observations, and we set the basis for a standardized approach to MIS 5e paleo sea-level reconstructions, that is already successfully applied in Holocene sea-level research. Application of the standard definitions and methodologies described in this paper will enhance our ability to compare data from different research groups and different areas, in order to gain deeper insights into MIS 5e sea-level changes. Improving estimates of Last Interglacial sea-level is, in turn, a key to understanding the behavior of ice sheets in a warmer world.},

	abstract = {Estimates of peak global mean sea level (GMSL) during the Last Interglacial (LIG, ∼129-116 ka) based on geological sea level high-stand markers require a correction for the contaminating influence of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This correction is obtained by calculating the viscoelastic response of the Earth to changes in the ice and ocean load prior to and following the LIG. While ice retreat over the last deglaciation is relatively well constrained, changes in ice cover prior to the LIG are more uncertain. We investigate the sensitivity of numerical predictions of GIA during the LIG to variations in the geometry of pre-LIG ice cover and the timing of the deglaciation into the LIG, with a particular focus on Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (∼190-130 ka). We demonstrate that reconstructing the pre-LIG ice history by replicating the last glacial cycle back in time, rather than using ice volume approximations based on oxygen isotope records, can introduce errors in LIG high-stand predictions of ∼5 m at sites on the peripheral bulge of major ice complexes, and up to ∼2 m at far-field sites. We also demonstrate that predictions of LIG sea level are more sensitive to the geographic distribution of ice cover during MIS 6 than previously recognized. Adopting simulations which vary the relative size of Late Pleistocene ice cover over North America and Eurasia can yield a change in predicted high-stand elevations of ∼5 m in both the near and far field of northern hemisphere ice sheets. This far-field sensitivity arises, in part, from the reorientation of Earth's rotation axis during MIS 6, which in turn drives sea-level changes with a distinct geographic signature. In future work we will apply the insights gained here to re-evaluate the observed geographic variability in geological high-stand markers of LIG age and estimates of GMSL based upon them.},

@article{Dyere2021,
	abstract = {The seas are rising as the planet warms, and reconstructions of past sea level provide critical insight into the sensitivity of ice sheets to warmer temperatures. Past sea level is reconstructed from the geologic record by measuring the elevations of fossilized marine sediments and coral reefs. However, the elevations of these features also record local uplift or subsidence due to the growth and decay of ice sheets since the time of deposition. We compare observations of paleo sea level across the Bahamian archipelago with a range of Earth deformation models to revise estimates of the last interglacial global mean sea level. Our results suggest that polar ice sheets may be less sensitive to high-latitude warming than previously thought.During the last interglacial (LIG) period, global mean sea level (GMSL) was higher than at present, likely driven by greater high-latitude insolation. Past sea-level estimates require elevation measurements and age determination of marine sediments that formed at or near sea level, and those elevations must be corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). However, this GIA correction is subject to uncertainties in the GIA model inputs, namely, Earth{\textquoteright}s rheology and past ice history, which reduces precision and accuracy in estimates of past GMSL. To better constrain the GIA process, we compare our data and existing LIG sea-level data across the Bahamian archipelago with a suite of 576 GIA model predictions. We calculated weights for each GIA model based on how well the model fits spatial trends in the regional sea-level data and then used the weighted GIA corrections to revise estimates of GMSL during the LIG. During the LIG, we find a 95\% probability that global sea level peaked at least 1.2 m higher than today, and it is very unlikely (5\% probability) to have exceeded 5.3 m. Estimates increase by up to 30\% (decrease by up to 20\%) for portions of melt that originate from the Greenland ice sheet (West Antarctic ice sheet). Altogether, this work suggests that LIG GMSL may be lower than previously assumed.All data, models, and code used in this work are available in GitHub (https://github.com/blakedyer/bahamas_lig/) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4908080).},

	abstract = {Studies of sea level during previous interglacials provide insight into the stability of polar ice sheets in the face of global climate change. Commonly, these studies correct ancient sea-level highstands for the contaminating effect of isostatic adjustment associated with past ice age cycles, and interpret the residuals as being equivalent to the peak eustatic sea level associated with excess melting, relative to present day, of ancient polar ice sheets. However, the collapse of polar ice sheets produces a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change, which must be accounted for to accurately infer peak eustatic sea level from site-specific residual highstands. To explore this issue, we compute fingerprints associated with the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to isolate regions that would have been subject to greater-than-eustatic sea-level change for all three cases. These fingerprints are more robust than those associated with modern melting events, when applied to infer eustatic sea level, because: (1) a significant collapse of polar ice sheets reduces the sensitivity of the computed fingerprints to uncertainties in the geometry of the melt regions; and (2) the sea-level signal associated with the collapse will dominate the signal from steric effects. We evaluate these fingerprints at a suite of sites where sea-level records from interglacial marine isotopes stages (MIS) 5e and 11 have been obtained. Using these results, we demonstrate that previously discrepant estimates of peak eustatic sea level during MIS5e based on sea-level markers in Australia and the Seychelles are brought into closer accord.},

	abstract = {{Models of the glacial isostatic adjustment process, which is dominated by the influence of the Late Pleistocene cycle of glaciation and deglaciation, depend on two fundamental inputs: a history of ice-sheet loading and a model of the radial variation of mantle viscosity. These models may be tested and refined by comparing their local predictions of relative sea level history to geological inferences based upon appropriate sea level indicators. The U.S. Atlantic coast is a region of particular interest in this regard, due to the fact that data from the length of this coast provides a transect of the forebulge associated with the former Laurentide ice sheet. High-quality relative sea level histories from this region are employed herein to explore the ability of current models of mantle viscosity to explain the inferred evolution of relative sea level that have accompanied forebulge collapse following deglaciation. Existing misfits are characterized, and alternatives are explored for their reconciliation. It is demonstrated that a new model of mantle viscosity, referred to herein as VM6, when coupled with the latest model of deglaciation history ICE-6G\_C, is able to eliminate the majority of these misfits, while continuing to reconcile a wide range of other important geophysical observables, as well as additional relative sea level data from the North American.
